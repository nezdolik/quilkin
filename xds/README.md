# XDS Management Server

This project contains an [XDS] management server implementation that configures
Quilkin proxies.
The task of a management server is to continuously check for updates to
upstream endpoints and filter configuration from some external source, and then use
that information to generate cluster and filter updates that is pushed to any connected
Quilkin proxy.

## Opinionated Agones Implementation

The server can be run by a quilkin commmand name _manage_.

1. Cluster information is retrieved from [Agones] - the server watches for `Allocated`
   [Agones GameServers] and exposes their IP address and Port as [upstream endpoints][upstream-endpoint] to
   any connected Quilkin proxies.
   The set of tokens for the associated endpoint can be set by adding a comma separated standard base64 encoded strings.
   This must be added under an annotation `quilkin.dev/tokens` in the [GameServer][Agones GameServers]'s spec.
   For example:
   ```yaml
   annotations:
     Sets two tokens for the corresponding endpoint with values 1x7ijy6 and 8gj3v2i respectively.
     quilkin.dev/tokens: MXg3aWp5Ng==,OGdqM3YyaQ==
   ```

   > Since an Agones GameServer can have multiple ports exposed, if multiple ports are in
   > use, the server looks for the port named `default` and picks that as the endpoint's
   > port (otherwise it picks the first port in the port list).

2. Filter chain is configurable on a per-proxy basis. By default an empty filter chain is
   used and from there the filter chain can configured using annotations on the proxy's pod.
   The following annotations are currently supported:
   - **quilkin.dev/debug-packets**: If set to the value `true`, then a `Debug` filter will be
     added to the filter chain, causing all packets will be logged.
   - **quilkin.dev/routing-token-suffix-size**: Sets the size (in number of bytes) of routing tokens appended to
     packets. Extracted tokens will matched against available endpoints in order to figure out
     where to send the associated packet.
     Note that the token is stripped off the packet. This annotation cannot be provided together with
     `quilkin.dev/routing-token-prefix-size`.
   - **quilkin.dev/routing-token-prefix-size**: Works exactly the same as `quilkin.dev/routing-token-suffix-size`
     with the difference that the token is a prefix on the packet rather than a suffix.

As an example, the following runs the server with subcommnad _agones_ against a cluster (using default kubeconfig configuration) where Quilkin pods run in the `quilkin` namespace and game-server pods run in the `gameservers` namespace:

```sh
quilkin manage --port 18000 agones --config-namespace quilkin --gameservers-namespace gameservers
```

> A proxy's pod must have a `quilkin.dev/role` annotation set to the value `proxy` in order
  for the management server to detect the pod as a proxy and push updates to it.

> Note that currently, the server can only discover resources within a single cluster.

## Admin server

In addition the gRPC server, a http server (configurable via `--admin-port`is also started to serve administrative functionality.
The following endpoints are provided:
- `/ready`: Readiness probe that returns a 5xx if communication with the Kubernetes api is problematic.
- `/live`: Liveness probe that always returns a 200 response.
- `/metrics`: Exposes Prometheus metrics.

## Metrics

The following metrics are exposed by the management server.

- `quilkin_management_server_connected_proxies` (Gauge)

   The number of proxies currently connected to the server.
- `quilkin_management_server_discovery_requests_total{request_type}` (Counter)

   The total number of xDS Discovery requests received across all proxies.
   - `request_type` = `type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster` | `type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment` | `type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.listener.v3.Listener`
     Type URL of the requested resource
- `quilkin_management_server_discovery_responses_total` (Counter)

   The total number of xDS Discovery responses sent back across all proxies in response to Discovery Requests.
   Each Discovery response sent corresponds to a configuration update for some proxy.
   - `request_type` = `type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster` | `type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment` | `type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.listener.v3.Listener`
     Type URL of the requested resource
- `quilkin_management_server_endpoints_total` (Gauge)

   The number of active endpoints discovered by the server. The number of active endpoints
   correlates with the size of the cluster configuration update sent to proxies.
- `quilkin_management_server_snapshot_generation_errors_total` (Counter)

   The total number of errors encountered while generating a configuration snapshot update for a proxy.
- `quilkin_management_server_snapshots_generated_total` (Counter)

   The total number of configuration snapshot generated across all proxies. A snapshot corresponds
   to a point in time view of a proxy's configuration. However it does not necessarily correspond
   to a proxy update - a proxy only gets the latest snapshot so it might miss intermediate
   snapshots if it lags behind.
- `quilkin_management_server_snapshots_cache_size` (Gauge)

   The current number of snapshots in the in-memory snapshot cache. This corresponds 1-1 to
   proxies that connect to the server. However the number may be slightly higher than the number
   of connected proxies since snapshots for disconnected proxies are only periodically cleared
   from the cache.

## Example: File Server Implementation

> The file server command is primarily an example and mostly suitable for demo purposes.
> As a result, some configuration options and features might be missing.

The file implementation that watches a configuration file on disk and sends updates to proxies whenever that file changes.
It can be started with using subcommnad _file_ as the following:
```sh
quilkin manage --port 18000 file --config-file-path config.yaml
```

After running this command, any proxy that connects to port 18000 will receive updates as configured in `config.yaml` file.

The configuration file schema is:
```yaml
# clusters contain a list of clusters.
# Each entry represents a cluster configuration.
clusters: [{
  # Name of the cluster.
  name: string

  # List of endpoints belonging to the cluster.
  # Each entry represents an upstream endpoint.
  endpoints: [{
    # The endpoint's IP address.
    ip: int
    # The endpoint's port.
    port: int
    # Opaque metadata that will be the endpoint's metadata.
    metadata: {}
  }]
}]

# filterchain represents the filter chain configuration.
# It contains a list of filter configurations.
filterchain: [{
  # Name of the filter
  name: string

  # typed_config contains the filter's configuration.
  typed_config: {
    # @type must be equivalent to name - the name of the filter.
    # It is an extra, required field.
    '@type': string
    # ...
    # The rest of the body contains filter specific configuration or
    # is empty if the filter has no configuration.
  }
}]
```
Example:
```yaml
clusters:
- name: cluster-a
  endpoints:
  - ip: 123.0.0.1
    port": 29
    metadata:
      'quilkin.dev':
         tokens:
         - "MXg3aWp5Ng=="
filterchain:
- name: quilkin.filters.debug.v1alpha1.Debug
  typed_config:
    '@type': quilkin.filters.debug.v1alpha1.Debug
    id: hello
```
